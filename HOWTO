Using configure.inc in a configuration shellscript

1) set up local option handling and --help

|ac_help='--option1	what option1 is
|--option2	what option2 is'
|
|LOCAL_AC_OPTIONS=`
|case X"$1" in
|X--option1) option1=T; shift 1;;
|X--option2) option2=T; shift 2;;
|*) ac_error=1;;
|esac'

2) include configure.inc (loads all functions, parses command options)

| . ./configure.inc

   The script joincfg.sh can be used to merge configure.inc into
   configure.sh (deleting configure.inc in the process) so you
   can ship a tarball that will work with configure.sh --srcdir.


3) call AC_INIT to start configuring.  After this point, all output goes
   to config.log unless you redirect it to file descriptor 5.

| AC_INIT HOWTO

3) do whatever configuration you might want to do (look in the samples
   directory)

4) when you're done, call AC_OUTPUT to finalize all the changes written
   into config.* files, then process .in files

| AC_OUTPUT Makefile.in subdir/Makefile.in

5) you're done, and the caller should now be able to run make


Environment variables configure.inc uses

CC="c compiler"
CFLAGS="options for compiling code"
LDFLAGS="options for linking code"
AC_LIBS="libraries that are needed to build"



Commands available from configure.inc


LOG		write a message to the terminal and th logfile
LOGN		write a message to the terminal without a newline at the end,
		but to the logfile with a newline at the end.
TLOG		write a message to the terminal
TLOGN		write a message to the terminal, without a newline.

AC_CONTINUE	don't terminate if something goes wrong.

AC_CHECK_HEADERS hdr
		checks to see if a given C headerfile is there.
		If it is, write HAVE_<hdr> into config.h
		and internally to configure

AC_CHECK_FUNCS	ftn [headers]
		checks to see if a function is there.
		If it is, write HAVE_<ftn> into config.h
		and internally to configure

AC_LIBRARY	ftn [headers] [-llibrary {...}]
		Check to see if a function exists in the current
		library set or one of a list of new libraries.

AC_CHECK_FIELD	structure field include0 ... includeN
		checks if <structure> contains <field>.
		if it does, define HAVE_<structure>_<field> in
		config.h and internally to configure

AC_CHECK_RESOLVER
		Look for the bind4 resolver library, and do
		some parania checks to see that it's the 
		proper version of the library.  The function
		also checks to see if you need to set BIND_8_COMPAT
		(for the broken bind library on Darwin, and probably
		for FreeBSD 6 and Dragonfly BSD)

AC_PROG_CC	finds the C compiler and checks to see if it works
		if it does, set AC_CC to the path to the compiler
		(OVERRIDE with CC=), AC_CFLAGS to the provided CFLAGS,
		AC_LDFLAGS to the provided LDFLAGS, and sets substitutions
		in config.sub

acLookFor	quietly looks for a program
		Returns "" or the pathname of the program.

MF_PATH_INCLUDE	<file> <candidate0 ... candidateN>
		checks for a file in a list of candidates.
		If it finds it, define HAVE_<file> to 1 in
		config.mak, PATH_<file> to the full pathname of
		the file in config.h, substitute @<file>@ with
		the full pathname in config.sub, and create a local
		variable CF_<file> for configure to use.

AC_INIT	initializes configure
		Initialize config.log, config.sub, config.h,
		config.mak, and zeros config.cmd.  Also checks to
		see whether echo -n or echo\c is how to echo without
		newlines.  Rearranges file descriptors so that
		stdout and stderr point to config.log, and fd 5 points
		to the original stdout.
		sets up local variables AC_PREFIX, AC_EXECDIR, AC_LIBDIR,
		AC_MANDIR, AC_CONFDIR, AC_SRCDIR.
		If --with-path was given on the command line, set AC_PATH
		from it, otherwise set AC_PATH to the current $PATH.
		runs AC_PROG_CPP to find cpp
		runs AC_PROG_INSTALL to find install


AC_PROG_YACC	looks for yacc, and trys to figure out if it's yacc or
		something else. If it's bison, define BISON in config.mak,
		and YACC as bison -y; if it's yacc, just define YACC.
		Otherwise like MF_PATH_INCLUDE
AC_PROG_LN_S	looks for ln, and sees if ln -s (symlinks) works.
                Otherwise like MF_PATH_INCLUDE
AC_PROG_FIND	looks for find
                Otherwise like MF_PATH_INCLUDE
AC_PROG_SET	looks for sed
                Otherwise like MF_PATH_INCLUDE

AC_HEADER_SYS_WAIT
		looks for sys/wait.h ( AC_CHECK_HEADERS sys/wait.h )

AC_TYPE_PID_T	looks to see if the pid_t type exists.

AC_C_CONST	checks that the ``const'' keyword exists

AC_OUTPUT	finishes configure, processes .in files

AC_PROG_INSTALL	find the install program, determine whether it's gnu
		install or BSD install

AC_PROG_CPP	looks for cpp.

AC_FAIL		spits out an error message to the log, then either
		exits or continues (depending on if AC_CONTINUE was
                previously called)

AC_SUB		writes a substitution into config.sub
AC_MAK		writes a Makefile define into config.mak

AC_DEFINE	def value
		writes a #define into config.h

AC_INCLUDE	file
		writes #include "file" into config.h

AC_CONFIG	writes a PATH_ variable into config.h, a makefile define
		into config.mak, and a substitution into config.sub
