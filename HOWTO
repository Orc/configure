LOG		write a message to the terminal and th logfile
LOGN		write a message to the terminal without a newline at the end,
		but to the logfile with a newline at the end.
TLOG		write a message to the terminal
TLOGN		write a message to the terminal, without a newline.

AC_CONTINUE	don't terminate if something goes wrong.

AC_CHECK_HEADERS hdr
		checks to see if a given C headerfile is there.
		If it is, write HAVE_<hdr> into config.h
		and internally to configure

AC_CHECK_FUNCS	ftn
		checks to see if a function is there.
		If it is, write HAVE_<ftn> into config.h
		and internally to configure

AC_CHECK_FIELD	structure field include0 ... includeN
		checks if <structure> contains <field>.
		if it does, define HAVE_<structure>_<field> in
		config.h and internally to configure

AC_PROG_CC	finds the C compiler and checks to see if it works
		if it does, set AC_CC to the path to the compiler
		(OVERRIDE with CC=), AC_CFLAGS to the provided CFLAGS,
		AC_LDFLAGS to the provided LDFLAGS, and sets substitutions
		in config.sub

acLookFor	quietly looks for a program
		Internal program, returns "" or the pathname of the program.

MF_PATH_INCLUDE	<file> <candidate0 ... candidateN>
		checks for a file in a list of candidates.
		If it finds it, define HAVE_<file> to 1 in
		config.mak, PATH_<file> to the full pathname of
		the file in config.h, substitute @<file>@ with
		the full pathname in config.sub, and create a local
		variable CF_<file> for configure to use.

AC_INIT	initializes configure
		Initialize config.log, config.sub, config.h,
		config.mak, and zeros config.cmd.  Also checks to
		see whether echo -n or echo\c is how to echo without
		newlines.  Rearranges file descriptors so that
		stdout and stderr point to config.log, and fd 5 points
		to the original stdout.
		sets up local variables AC_PREFIX, AC_EXECDIR, AC_LIBDIR,
		AC_MANDIR, AC_CONFDIR, AC_SRCDIR.
		If --with-path was given on the command line, set AC_PATH
		from it, otherwise set AC_PATH to the current $PATH.
		runs AC_PROG_CPP to find cpp
		runs AC_PROG_INSTALL to find install


AC_PROG_YACC	looks for yacc, and trys to figure out if it's yacc or
		something else. If it's bison, define BISON in config.mak,
		and YACC as bison -y; if it's yacc, just define YACC.
		Otherwise like MF_PATH_INCLUDE
AC_PROG_LN_S	looks for ln, and sees if ln -s (symlinks) works.
                Otherwise like MF_PATH_INCLUDE
AC_PROG_FIND	looks for find
                Otherwise like MF_PATH_INCLUDE
AC_PROG_SET	looks for sed
                Otherwise like MF_PATH_INCLUDE

AC_HEADER_SYS_WAIT	looks for sys/wait.h ( AC_CHECK_HEADERS sys/wait.h )

AC_TYPE_PID_T	looks to see if the pid_t type exists.

AC_C_CONST	checks that the ``const'' keyword exists
AC_OUTPUT	finishes configure, processes .in files
AC_PROG_INSTALL	find the install program, determine whether it's gnu
		install or BSD install
AC_PROG_CPP	looks for cpp.
AC_FAIL		spits out an error message to the log, then either
		exits or continues (depending on if AC_CONTINUE was
                previously called)
AC_SUB		writes a substitution into config.sub
AC_MAK		writes a Makefile define into config.mak
AC_DEFINE	writes a #define into config.h
AC_CONFIG	writes a PATH_ variable into config.h, a makefile define
		into config.mak, and a substitution into config.sub
